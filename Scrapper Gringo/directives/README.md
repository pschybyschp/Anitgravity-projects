# Directives

This folder contains **SOP-style instructions** written in Markdown.

## Purpose

Directives define:
- **Goals** – What needs to be accomplished
- **Inputs** – What information is needed
- **Tools/Scripts** – Which execution scripts to use
- **Outputs** – Expected deliverables
- **Edge Cases** – Known constraints and exceptions

## Guidelines

- Write in plain language, as if briefing a competent teammate
- Keep directives focused on a single task or workflow
- Update directives when you discover new constraints or better approaches
- Do not overwrite or delete directives unless explicitly instructed

## File Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores:
- `scrape_website.md`
- `generate_report.md`
- `upload_to_drive.md`
